# Toolset for an easy management of 3GPP specifications

Handling many 3GPP standards could be complex and a timelasting procedure. The ongoing standardiziation and different release versions are leading to frequent updates of the standard documents. The following tools might be helpful and are free to use.

### Prerequisites and Installing

The scripts are written in python. Version 3.6 or more up to date is needed. We implemented the scripts under Microsoft Windows 10 and if you want using the toolset in a comprised way, you also need Microsoft Word and Excel.
Several python packages are needed as well. You can use the python package index for installing the needed packages as follows:

```
pip install pywin32
pip install openpyxl
pip install lxml
pip install requests
pip install pypdf2
pip install bibtexparser
```

Infos regarding to python and the pip you'll find here: https://www.python.org/ or https://pypi.org/

## Usage of standardsHelper.py

First of all, visit the 3GPP Portal via https://portal.3gpp.org/ and choose the tab "Specifications".
